## Introduction

K8s Pro Sentinel is a powerful Kubernetes security operator designed to bolster the security of your Kubernetes clusters. It functions as a vigilant sentinel, continuously monitoring, auditing, and securing your cluster's resources, ensuring that your applications and infrastructure adhere to the highest security standards.

## Features

- **Automated Security Checks:** K8s Pro Sentinel automates a wide range of security checks, including RBAC policy analysis, secrets management, and more.

- **Comprehensive Auditing:** Gain deep insights into the security status of your cluster through detailed audit logs and reports. Easily track security violations and their resolution.

- **RBAC Best Practices:** Ensure that your Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configurations adhere to best practices, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.

- **Secrets Management:** Safeguard sensitive information by monitoring secrets usage and ensuring compliance with security policies.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).


### Prerequisites

Before getting started with K8s Pro Sentinel, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Kubernetes Cluster
- Kubectl (Kubernetes CLI) installed
- [Optional] Docker (for building custom images)

### Installation

1. Clone the K8s Pro Sentinel repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kavinduxo/k8s-pro-sentinel.git


### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/sentinal-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/sentinal-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
